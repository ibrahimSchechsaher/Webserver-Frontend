# Web Application for Heightmap WGAN

The template that we used for our project is found [here](https://github.com/designcourse/threejs-webpack-starter).

## Before starting the WebApp

Get the Backend for this WebFrontend and start it [here](https://github.com/khoi-ng/Webserver-Backend.git).

This is important, because the Backend provides the generated Heightmaps for the Frontend.

After you started the Backend, you can start the Frontend.

## How to start the WebApp/Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
